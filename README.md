# Using Kmeans to find new NBA PlayerTypes
Inspired by a few Medium articles, in this repository we'll group NBA players using Kmeans algorithm to analyse each type of players and to suggest new signings.

In the world of professional basketball, particularly the NBA, players exhibit diverse playing styles and strengths. This project aims to apply K-Means clustering to group NBA players based on their possession percentages in various play-types. By doing so, we seek to uncover distinctive player profiles, enhance performance analysis in the NBA.
Additionally, we aim to propose potential player acquisitions to replace those with similar playing styles, contributing to strategic decision-making for teams.
